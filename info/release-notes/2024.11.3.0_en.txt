Hello everyone!

The tModLoader team has had a bit of a slower month, as we take time to take a breath and relax to close out the year. We will be back at it in 2025, ready to take TML to the next level!

This month's release is relatively light. We will be trialing some performance improvements in backend mod validation and an optimization in player DrawEffects in preview.

We'd like to remind modders about the preview branch where we test new features before they arrive in stable the following month. Modders interested in these new features, listed both on our GitHub and in the #preview-update-log of our Discord, can join the preview branch to get early access to the new features and test them in their mods. We really appreciate the feedback from modders using the preview branch to try out the new features.

Major features currently in preview (starting December 1st) include greatly improved enemy banner support and support for custom data sets. Please give them a test and let us know if you run into any issues.

As always, if you are having issues of any sort, definitely don't hesitate to check out our [url=https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Usage-FAQ]FAQ on GitHub[/url] or reach out to us at [url=https://discord.com/invite/tmodloader]our Discord[/url].
