Title: November 2024 Stable Update

----------------------

It is time for the November 2024 Stable Update.

The tModLoader team and our amazing community of contributors continues to improve tModLoader. Once again this month's release contains many improvements to the user experience, some gameplay bug fixes, as well as new features with examples and documentation for mod makers.

We'd like to remind modders about the preview branch where we test new features before they arrive in stable the following month. Modders interested in new these features, listed both on our GitHub and in the #preview-update-log of our Discord, can join the preview branch to get early access to the new features and test them in their mods. We really appreciate the feedback from modders using the preview branch to try out the new features.

One feature we are currently previewing is additional support for modded tiles that react to wind and player movement, as some vanilla tiles do. Modders on the preview branch can test it out and make sure it works correctly for chandeliers, banners, vines, and other similar tiles.

As always, if you are having issues of any sort, definitely don't hesitate to check out our [url=https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Usage-FAQ]FAQ on GitHub[/url] or reach out to us at [url=https://discord.com/invite/tmodloader]our Discord[/url].
