【选段1】

语境：前文提到了“去某地的路”。

The track was flanked on either side by knee-high grass and speckles of white and bright yellow flowers. The track snaked uphill and led to a flat field where poplars and cottonwoods soared and wild bushes grew in clusters.

The path ended perpendicular to a wide, trout-filled stream, which rolled down from the Kalifoh mountains, there was a circular grove of weeping willow trees.

【选段2】
