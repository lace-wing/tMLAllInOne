Speaking of sleeping, it has merely two features in the game: setting a spawn point or speeding up time. And how interesting would it be to spawn on an NPC? Forget about all those boring static spawn points, we can have a dynamic one that spices up our gameplay. I’m tired of looking at the same exact frame every time I die, and I’m sure you are too! This would also encourage players to build actual homes, not NPC prisons.

Moreover, it would let us relieve stress. Calamity is a stressful mod enough, requiring constant attention especially while fighting bosses. So a break to refresh ourselves would be great. Now I ask you what can you do in Calamity to take a break? Mining? Fishing? Grinding? No! Those or the risk of mobs still require some work. Instead, sleeping on the laps of a character who also needs love is truly awesome in order to mitigate pressure and change the pace.
