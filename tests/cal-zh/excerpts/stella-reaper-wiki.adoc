Stella Reaper is a craftable post-Moon Lord rogue boomerang. It rapidly throws high velocity scythes which can pierce through infinite enemies and pass through tiles. The scythe moves extremely quickly and ignores NPC immunity frames, allowing it to rack up enormous damage against large targets. When the scythes strike a target, it has 15% chance to summon a homing non-piercing astral star which deals 40% of the scythes damage and can create a small explosion on hit raining to a random enemy. The explosion deals 100 rouge damage and affected by damage bonuses. The scythes and the explosion will inflict God Slayer Inferno on any enemies hit.

Performing a stealth strike with the Stella Reaper causes 10 charged astral stars which deals 60% of the scythes damage raining towards the cursor's position. The charged astral stars cannot pierce but will create a big explosion when hitting any enemy or block. The big explosion will deal 200 rouge damage which is affected by damage bonuses and inflict God Slayer Inferno.
Its best modifier is Flawless.
