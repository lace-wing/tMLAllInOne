...long ago, two races ruled over Terraria: humans and dragons.
Dragons have control over one aspect of the world each.

One day, a space-squid came by and said "I HATE DRAGONS. CALAMARI GANG RISE UP."
And since the space-squid yelled it in a low-income dragon neighborhood, he proceeded to get jumped by the entire dragon population.
They couldn't kill him, so they sent him to the Moon for him to stay for eternity.

Sadly, the space-squid (who calls himself Moon Lord now) was pretty strong and killed a lot of dragons.
One of the dragons killed was the king, whose aspect was the sun.
However, since dragons can respawn after a ritual is done, everyone went "Oh, okay."

Until...

The monk who would have revived the king decided to absorb his soul instead, making him a "god". Or maybe the king wanted him to do it? We donâ€™t know.

People heard about the new god and went "Wait, I can do that? Cool!" and they started poaching dragons for their souls (keep in mind that some dragons were probably evil or willing to be absorbed).
