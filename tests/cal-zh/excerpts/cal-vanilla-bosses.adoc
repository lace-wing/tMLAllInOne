There are a lot of new bosses in the Calamity mod, and _a lot_ is no exaggeration.
Vanilla bosses haven't been left out of the fun, though, as every single boss that can be fought in the original experience has been given improved AI and new attacks to keep Terraria veterans on their toes.

Though the changes are fairly minor for some (like the Eye of Cthulu, which simply goes to its second phase more quickly), bosses like Plantera can go from a Pre-Cultist pit stop to a brick wall that requires significant preparation to conquer.
Each boss also drops an item that expands on their lore in the context of the mod, making Calamity feel more like a sequel than a modification.
