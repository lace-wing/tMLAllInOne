Terraria's game logic updates 60 times per second, meaning that if there is no immunity frame, any player in contact with a hostile entity will be hit 60 times in just a single second: even the weakest slime can instakill an unarmored player at this rate.

Hence, immunity frame was introduced to create a window for escaping from the next hit, which is typically indicated by a distinct blinking visual effect on affected entities. It sometimes serves as a bonus rather than a compensation. For instance, Brain of Confusion enables players to directly dodge an attack instead of being invulnerable only after taking the damage.

However, said mechanism can be exploited to make fights way easier than they should be. Constantly taking low damage, players may buy immunity frames that negate high-damage attacks from elites or bosses. Not all hostiles would be tricked by this technique, though.
